# BrainStorm

INSPIRATION: My friend challenged me to make a tower defense game (his favorite). I wanted it to change with each iteration (like a rogue or dungeon game), and I wanted to fill it with bad puns, hence ... BRAIN STORM.

CONTROLS: 
- On the title screen, click anywhere to create the first (and for now, only) level. 
- The bolt-path will randomly create itself, and the (for now, only) enemy will come fairly quickly.
- Place your tower on the screen in a place that will cover the most territory.
- If tower coverage is enough to zap the enemy, you win!
- If not, you lose :(.

TECH:
- Randomized lightning bolt-path maker
- Measuring distance and points between points (for path and for enemies)
- Use of overlaying Canvas elements

BUGS / REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY:
- Having issues breaking from a function (YOU ALWAYS LOSE EVENTUALLY AS THE ENEMY KEEPS TECHNICALLY MOVING)
- Inconsistencies between Canvas images and Canvas-drawn art (difficult to place consistently or keep from disappearing)
- Need to make more dynamic in general (needs more Promises and Class work)
- Only one enemy, one tower, and one level for now
